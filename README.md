Messin' With Strings
---

I find myself often  struggling when working with Strings/str's in Rust.

Somethings I'd like to figure out:

* When to use str versus String
* how/when/why/which to concatenate
* how to return str from function
* lifetimes and how they relate to strings
* when to convert to String, and when to take a slice
